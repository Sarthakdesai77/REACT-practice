This is a Dog Picture finding React.js App

Here is a link to the deployed app on netlify:



This app allows you to:

View a list of dog breeds
Click on the breed button to view a picture of the dog
Click on "New Pic!" to view a different pic, and keep clicking to cycle through more pictures
Click to go back to the breeds list
Design choices in this:

it is designed to load up an initial list of breeds so that there's no delay
it renders the card holding dog pictures in-place, so that after viewing a dog, users can navigate back without losing their place
it allows multiple cards to open so that users can compare dog pics accross breeds
it updates the list of breeds and images etc with fresh data from the api so that you always get the hottest pics of dogs!

Thanks for checking it out!
